# Creating a New Faction

To add a new faction on your server:

1. Add the new faction to the faction\_list table. Assign a value to base\_value that indicates, aside from class/race/deity adjustments, how your new faction will regard everyone.
2. Add an entry to faction\_base\_data if you want the limits on earned faction to differ from -2000 to 2000.

| Faction Value | Faction CON |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1100 -&gt; ABOVE | ALLY |
| 750 -&gt; 1099 | WARMLY |
| 500 -&gt; 749 | KINDLY |
| 100 -&gt; 400 | AMIABLE |
| 0 -&gt; 99 | INDIFFERENT |
| -100 -&gt; -1 | APPREHENSIVE |
| -500 -&gt; -101 | DUBIOUS |
| -750 -&gt; -501 | THREATENLY |
| BELOW -&gt; -751 | SCOWLS |

1. Decide if you want your faction to favor or dislike characters more of less based on their class, race or deity. If so, add entries to faction\_list\_mod for your newly created faction.
2. Every NPC that you want to be on your new faction, will have to be on a new npc\_faction that has a primary\_faction set to your new faction from faction\_list. But unless all the NPCS that you want will all have the same faction hits when killed, you'll need a separate npc\_faction for each tier of hits. I hope we can factor this part out in a future work product.
3. If you want to assign faction hits or gains for killing any npc on your newly created npc\_faction, add these entries to npc\_faction\_entries using your new npc\_faction\_id.
4. If you want your newly created faction members to attack or assist certain other factions, add these entries to npc\_faction\_entries using your new npc\_faction\_id.
5. Assign the NPCs you want to your new npc\_faction.
6. Restart the server for this to take effect. We'll work on a live reloading mechanism.
