# World Servers with Same Names

There may be a case where you have servers with the same exact short name, long name may be slightly different. These servers are often split between **Production** and **Staging (Testing)** servers. Before this was not a possible configuration.

Currently as of this writing, you CAN have both servers live in harmony as long as one of of the servers is **registered** and the other is **unregistered**. You can not have servers both attempt to use the same name otherwise you'll be fighting for listings
