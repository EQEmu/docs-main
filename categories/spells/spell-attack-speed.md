# Spell Attack Speed

* **SE\_AttackSpeed**
  * **Standard Haste and Slows**
    * Baseline attack speed is set at a value of 100.
    * This spell effect modifies that value.
      * **Haste**
        * Haste spells will have a value greater than 100.
        * Haste amount is calculated at \(Value - 100\). 
        * Example: [Swift like the Wind](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=172&source=Live) \(Value = 160\) 
          * 160 - 100 = 60% Haste
        * Haste Caps
          * Lv 60+ = **\(100\)**
          * Lv 51 - 59 = **\(85\)**
          * Lv &lt; 50 = **\(level + 25\)**
      * **Slow**
        * Slow spells will have a value less than 100
        * Slow amount is calculated at \(100 - Value\)
        * Example: [Sha's Legacy](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6828&source=Live) \(Value = 35\)
          * 100 - 35 = 65% Slow
        * Stacking: Slow will always overwrite haste in the same spell slot.
      * **Slow Mitigation**
        * Set in npc\_types table 'slow\_mitigation'
        * Decreases the potency of a slow effect by a percent as defined in the table

| **Range** | **Client Message when cast on an NPC with slow mitigation** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 - 25 % | "Your spell was mostly successful" |
| 26 - 74 % |  "Your spell was partially successful" |
| 74 - 100% |  "Your spell was slightly successful" |

* **SE\_AttackSpeed2 \(98\)**
  * **Stackable Haste \(w/ SE\_AttackSpeed\) that does not go over the haste cap**
    * Calculated same as SE\_AttackSpeed
    * Value stacks directly with with SE\_AttackSpeed.
    * Example: [Swift like the Wind](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=172&source=Live) \(60%\) + [Composition of Ervaj](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1452&source=Live) **\(10%\)** = 70% Haste
    * Can also be used a stackable slow effect as seen in [Al'Kabors Spiral of Deadly Force](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=17974&source=Live)
* **SE\_AttackSpeed3 \(119\)**
  * **Stackable Haste \(w/ SE\_AttackSpeed + SE\_AttackSpeed2\) that can go over the haste cap**
    * The direct spell effect value is added to the haste derived from SE\_AttackSpeed and SE\_AttackSpeed2 and will exceed the haste cap.
    * Example \(**IF CAP AT 100**\): [Swift like the Wind](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=172&source=Live) \(60%\) + [Composition of Ervaj](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1452&source=Live) \(10%\) + Item Haste \(30%\) = 100% + [Ancient Power](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6375&source=Live) **\(10%\) =** 110% Haste
    * Can also be used as a stackable slow effect as seen in [Taking Root](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=31853&source=Live)
    * Overhaste Caps
      * Lv 51+ = **\(25\)** 
      * Lv 1 - 50 = **\(10\)**
* **SE\_AttackSpeed4**
  * **Stackable slow effect \(w/ SE\_AttackSpeed\)**
    * **When slowed by SE\_AttackSpeed:** This effect decreases the remaining portion of your attack speed value NOT lowered by standard slow
    * Example: \(SE\_AttackSpeed\) [Sha's Legacy](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6828&source=Live) 65% slow + \(SE\_AttackSpeed4\) [Lassitude](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=11785&source=Live) 25% slow
      * Sha's Legacy is calculated as 100 - 35 = 65% slow, therefore the remaining attack speed is \(35\)
      * Lassitude will now decrease the remaining value \(35\) by 25% = 16.5%
      * The total slowed value on the target would be 65% + 16.5% = 81.25% slow
    * **When NOT slowed by SE\_AttackSpeed:** This effect acts as a regular slow, decreasing attack speed by the full amount.
    * Note: The base value should always be set as a positive. There are a few examples of spells with negative values, however all of their descriptions indicate it as a slow effect \(It is likely developer error\)
