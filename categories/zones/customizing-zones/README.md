# Customizing Zones

|Tool|Flow|Ext|Link|Pros|Cons|
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|EQGZI|Blender (or any 3d modeler)| .blend|Modern and recommended|Still work ongoing to catch up to OpenZone
|OpenZone| OpenZone (.scn) | .scn           | All features available         | Very clunky, camera movement horrible, have to type in coordinates                                                                   |
|OpenZone| 3d Studio Max   | .3ds           | Native modeling controls       | Unverified if works with latest version, might have poly limits?                                                                     |
|OpenZone| Quake 3         | .bsp           | Ongoing updates, easy UI, free | BSP-Based rules are ultimately turned to normal polygons, meaning the process is quite clunky and untuitive and not always optimized |
|OpenZone| Dungeon Builder | .3ds           | TBD                            | Primitive conversion, not a clean pipeline.                                                                                          |
