# Getting Started with EQGZI

TODO: Intro paraph explaining what EQGZI is, etc.. describe also the purpose of this page, and how it'll run step by step on the installation process

## Initial setup:
- This is just a temporary TODO to expand later..
- Download latest EQGZI, set up PATH env variable to point to eqgzi.exe, and how to structure a folder to prep for process
- Teach how to do a flow from Blender
- Create new pages for each 3d modeling tool, e.g. Maya, 3ds max, and basically the manual process until we write plugins to support each one.
- Start documenting object types in blender, custom properties supported, and how to do various feature injections (with the different 3d modeling pages, perhaps we can generically create this page for all of them to refer to)
