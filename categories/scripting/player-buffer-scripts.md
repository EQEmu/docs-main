# Player Buffer Scripts

### Discipline Trainer

This script will allow an NPC to train all available disciplines up to the player's current level.

{% code title="Dave\_the\_Disciplinarian.pl" %}
```perl
sub EVENT_SAY {
	#:: Match text for "hail", case insensitive
	if ($text=~/hail/i) {
		#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
		$client->Message(15, "With just one look, I can see that you have forgotten the finer points of combat, $name.  Would you like me to [" . quest::saylink("teach") . "] you how to perform the skills that require more discipline than the basics?");
	}
	#:: Match text for "teach", case insensitive
	elsif ($text=~/teach/i) {
		#:: Clear out any existing disciplines (optional)
		quest::untraindiscs();
		#:: Train all disciplines up to the user's level
		quest::traindiscs($ulevel, 0);
		#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
		$client->Message(15, "You look like a more fierce combatant already! Go out and test your new abilities!");
		#:: Play a Ding! sound
		quest::ding();
	}
}

sub EVENT_ITEM {
	#:: Return unused items since we don't expect any handins
	plugin::returnUnusedItems();
}
```
{% endcode %}

If you would prefer that your players do not have to interact with an NPC, it is quite simple to add all new disciplines each time a player levels using a script.  You would simply add this snippet to your global quest script file.

This script will train all new disciplines when a player levels up:

{% code title="global/global\_player.pl" %}
```perl
sub EVENT_LEVEL_UP {
	#:: Train all disciplines, maximum set to player's level, minimum set to the level prior
	quest::traindiscs($ulevel,$ulevel - 1);
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Spell Scriber

This script will scribe all available spells \(or songs\) up to the player's current level.

{% code title="Skippy\_the\_Scribe.pl" %}
```perl
sub EVENT_SAY {
	#:: Match text for "hail", case insensitive
	if ($text=~/hail/i) {
		#:: Separate response for melee classes--match classes using a string comparison (eq)
		if ($class eq 'Berserker' || $class eq 'Monk' || $class eq 'Rogue' || $class eq 'Warrior') {
			#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
			$client->Message(15, "Young fighter, I am the greatest spell scribe Norrath has ever seen--I do not waste my time on brutes like you!");
		}
		#:: Separate response for bards, who are always special
		elsif ($class eq 'Bard') {
			#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
			$client->Message(15, "With just one look, I can see that your songbook is lacking, $name.  Would you like me to [" . quest::saylink("scribe") . "] all of the known $class songs for you?");
		}
		#:: Separate response for casting classes
		elsif ($class eq 'Beastlord' || $class eq 'Cleric' || $class eq 'Druid' || $class eq 'Enchanter' || $class eq 'Magician' || $class eq 'Necromancer' || $class eq 'Paladin' || $class eq 'Ranger' || $class eq 'Shadowknight' || $class eq 'Shaman' || $class eq 'Wizard') {
			#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
			$client->Message(15, "With just one look, I can see that your spellbook is lacking, $name.  Would you like me to [" . quest::saylink("scribe") . "] all of the known $class spells for you?");
		}
	}
	#:: Match text for "scribe", case insensitive
	elsif ($text=~/scribe/i) {
		if ($class eq 'Bard' || $class eq 'Beastlord' || $class eq 'Cleric' || $class eq 'Druid' || $class eq 'Enchanter' || $class eq 'Magician' || $class eq 'Necromancer' || $class eq 'Paladin' || $class eq 'Ranger' || $class eq 'Shadowknight' || $class eq 'Shaman' || $class eq 'Wizard') {
			#:: Clear out any existing spells
			quest::unscribespells();
			#:: Scribe all spells up to the user's level
			quest::scribespells($ulevel, 0);
			#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
			$client->Message(15, "You look like a more powerful caster already! Go out and test your new spells!");
			#:: Play a Ding! sound
			quest::ding();
		}
		elsif ($class eq 'Berserker' || $class eq 'Monk' || $class eq 'Rogue' || $class eq 'Warrior') {
			$client->Message(15, "Begone, $class--lest I turn you into froglok tad!");
		}
	}
}

sub EVENT_ITEM {
	#:: Return unused items since we don't expect any handins
	plugin::returnUnusedItems();
}
```
{% endcode %}

As with disciplines, if you would prefer that your players do not have to interact with an NPC, it is quite simple to add all new spells/songs each time a player levels adding a snippet to your global quest file.  

This script will scribe all new spells/songs when a player levels up.

{% code title="global/global\_player.pl" %}
```perl
sub EVENT_LEVEL_UP {
	#:: Scribe all spells/songs, maximum set to player's level, minimum set to the level prior
	quest::scribespells($ulevel,$ulevel - 1);
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Skill Maxer

This script will set all available skills to their maximum amount at the player's current level.

{% code title="Scotty\_the\_Skilled.pl" %}
```perl
sub EVENT_SAY {
	#:: Match text for "hail", case insensitive
	if ($text=~/hail/i) {
		#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
		$client->Message(15, "Hello, $name!  It appears you could use some help with your [" . quest::saylink("skills") . "].  Would you like me to teach you?");
	}
	#:: Match text for "skills", case insensitive
	elsif ($text=~/skills/i) {
		#:: Set available (non-trade, non-casting specialization) skills to maximum for race/class at current level
		foreach my $skill ( 0 .. 42, 48 .. 54, 70 .. 74 ) {
			next unless $client->CanHaveSkill($skill);
			#:: Create a scalar variable to store each skill's maximum skill level at the player's current level
			my $maxSkill = $client->MaxSkill($skill, $client->GetClass(), $ulevel);
			#:: Check that the player's skill does not already exceed the maximum skill based on level
			next unless $maxSkill > $client->GetRawSkill($skill);
			#:: Set the skill to the maximum
			$client->SetSkill($skill, $maxSkill);
		}
		#:: Send a message that only the client can see, in yellow (15) text
		$client->Message(15, "You look like a more capable $class already! Go out and test your new skills!");
		#:: Play a Ding! sound
		quest::ding();
	}
}

sub EVENT_ITEM {
	#:: Return unused items since we don't expect any handins
	plugin::returnUnusedItems();
}
```
{% endcode %}

As with spells and disciplines, if you would prefer that your players do not have to interact with an NPC, it is quite simple to max all skills each time a player levels by adding a snippet to your global quest file.

This script will max all skills when a player levels up.

{% code title="global/global\_player.pl" %}
```perl
sub EVENT_LEVEL_UP {
	#:: Set available (non-trade, non-casting specialization) skills to maximum for race/class at current level
	foreach my $skill ( 0 .. 42, 48 .. 54, 70 .. 74 ) {
		next unless $client->CanHaveSkill($skill);
		#:: Create a scalar variable to store each skill's maximum skill level at the player's current level
		my $maxSkill = $client->MaxSkill($skill, $client->GetClass(), $ulevel);
		#:: Check that the player's skill does not already exceed the maximum skill based on level
		next unless $maxSkill > $client->GetRawSkill($skill);
		#:: Set the skill to the maximum
		$client->SetSkill($skill, $maxSkill);
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Player Buffer

This script will provide buffs and cures to the player and/or the player's pet, or the player's group and their pets, and will bind the player to the area. The NPC will charge the player for the good buffs.

Credit to Maze who created the original version of this script, which has been adapted for use on this wiki.

{% code title="Canary\_Morris.pl" %}
```perl
#:: Create a scalar vaiable to store the maximum level of buffs
$maxlevelbuffs = 70;
#:: Create a hash to define spells cast at each 10 levels, and their cost
#:: Keys are by each 10 levels, with differentiation for spells ranked as generic vs. advanced
#:: Values are each spell, by id, and the cost in platinum for each rank
