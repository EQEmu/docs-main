## Unix-like System Installation Instructions

These instructions are intended to be used on a freshly installed server.  Some services may have been enabled on your server when the provider installed the image.  You should still be able to reference these steps to configure your server.

### CentOS

Enable the appropriate MySQL Repo.

```
yum localinstall https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm
```

Install MySQL.

```
yum install mysql-community-server
```

Open the MySQL configuration file for edits.

```
nano /etc/my.cnf
```

Configure MySQL to list on all IPv4 addresses by adding the following lines to your configuration file.  Save your edits.

```
# Bind Address
bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

Enable the MySQL server executable to run on startup.

```
systemctl enable mysqld
```

Start the MySQL server.

```
systemctl start mysqld
```

Verify that all went well by checking your MySQL version.

```
mysql --version
```

Enable the web server executable to run on startup.

```
systemctl enable httpd.service
```

Start the web server.

```
systemctl start httpd.service
```

Install the Yum Utilities package.

```
yum install yum-utils –y
```

Install Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.

```
yum install epel-release –y
```

Set your configuration parameters to use PHP7+.

```
yum-config-manager --enable remi-php71
```

Install PHP packages.

```
yum install php php-common php-opcache php-mcrypt php-cli php-gd php-curl php-mysql
```

Locate your loaded PHP configuration file.

```
php -i | grep "Loaded Configuration File"
```

Open your PHP configuration file for editing (using the path indicated in the previous step).

```
nano [path]php.ini
```

Use the find command (ctrl+w) to locate the configuration parameter for short open tags.

```
# Set short_open_tag to ON
short_open_tag = On
```

Also look for **error\_reporting** to turn turn off some warnings.

```
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED
```

Navigate to the directory where you want to install the PEQ Database Editor and clone the GitHub Repository (i.e. /var/www/html).

### Ubuntu

_Big thanks to Gloat for running through this, and RedVapor for some example sed scripts and greps!_

{% hint style="info" %}
If you can skip having to sudo each line with (sudo -i or sudo su) it can save a lot of sudo's
{% endhint %}

Install MySQL

```
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Configure MySQL.  Start by going to the default install directory

```
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.cnf
```

Look for the Bind-Address section and set MySQL to listen on all interfaces

```
# Bind-Address
bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

Enable MySQL to run at startup

```
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

Start MySQL

```
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

Check that everything installed correctly

```
mysql --version
```

Install Apache

```
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

Enable Apache to run at startup

```
sudo systemctl enable apache2.service
```

Start Apache

```
sudo systemctl start apache2.service
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can point your browser to the ip address to make sure webserver is working at this point.
{% endhint %}

Install PHP

```
sudo apt install php php-common php-opcache php-cli php-gd php-curl php-mysql
```

Look for your loaded PHP configuration file

```
php -i | grep "Loaded Configuration File"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
There are a number of other different methods to find your php.ini file(s), such as using grep to search for the setting of interest:

```
grep -r short_open_tag /etc/php/
```
{% endhint %}

Edit your PHP configuration file (example file location used shown below)

```
sudo nano /etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd rather not use an editor to make the adjustments, a simple sed script can make them for you (an example for php v7.3 is below):

```
sudo sed -i 's/short_open_tag\ =\ Off/short_open_tag\ =\ on/g' /etc/php/7.3/apache2/php.ini
sudo sed -i 's/short_open_tag\ =\ Off/short_open_tag\ =\ on/g' /etc/php/7.3/cli/php.ini
```
{% endhint %}

Search (ctrl + W) for "short\_open\_tag"

```
short_open_tag = On
```

Also look for **error\_reporting** to turn turn off some warnings.

```
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED
```

Install Git

```
sudo apt install git -y
```

Go to your root web directory

```
cd /var/www
```

Clone in a copy of the PEQ Database Editor repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ProjectEQ/peqphpeditor.git
```

Copy the PEQ Database Editor to your html directory

```
sudo cp -ir peqphpeditor/. html/
```

Go to your html directory

```
cd html
```

Create a copy of your PEQ Database Editor Config file

```
sudo mv config.php.dist config.php
```

Open your config file for editing and input your settings

```
nano config.php
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on your environment, you may need to change ownership of the web directory.  An example is below (your user:group IDs might be different):

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
After all of these changes, it might be a good idea to restart Apache:

```
systemctl restart apache2
```
{% endhint %}

Execute the queries found in the sql directory on your database

```
cd sql
mysql -u<username> -p <database>
source schema.sql;
source expansions.sql;
quit
```

Point your web browser to `http://localhost/<editor-directory>/index.php` and login.  The default username / password are "admin", and "password".

## Windows

_Thanks to Korinthian for walking through these steps and providing screenshots!_

### Download XAMPP

XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP open source package has been set up to be incredibly easy to install and to use.

You can download XAMPP at:  [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

### Install XAMPP

Run the installer for XAMPP.  Choose `continue` when you receive the Windows Firewall warning, and `continue` to install XAMPP. &#x20;

Choose `OK` to approve the User Account Control (UAC) permission.

![UAC Warning](../../.gitbook/assets/uac-warning.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be sure to **deselect** MySQL!! (assuming you used the Akkadius EQEmu Server Installer, you already have MariaDB)
{% endhint %}

![Deselect MySQL before continuing](../../.gitbook/assets/deselect-mysql.png)

Choose `next` to continue installation.

Choose `next` to use the default installation directory (C:\xampp).

Choose your language settings and click `next`.

**Uncheck** the `learn more` box for Bitnami (unless you want to learn more about Bitnami, in which case a browser window will open).

Choose `next` to complete the installation.

Check the `Start Control Panel` option and `Finish`.

Click `Start` to start Apache.

![Start or Configure Apache](../../.gitbook/assets/start-apache.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
If you want to configure Apache auto-start, click on `config` (you will need to exit the control panel and restart as Admin to save the configuration).
{% endhint %}

![Be sure to Save your changes as Administrator](../../.gitbook/assets/auto-start-apache.png)

### Install PEQ Database Editor

Download a copy of the PEQ Database Editor from GitHub:  [https://github.com/ProjectEQ/peqphpeditor](https://github.com/ProjectEQ/peqphpeditor)

![Choose the Download Zip option](../../.gitbook/assets/download-peq.png)

Extract the contents of the zip file to `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to change the name of the PEQ Database Editor directory, now is the time.  Note that you can move the contents to the root htdocs directory.  Changing this name will effect the URL used to access the Editor.
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the `C:\xampp\htdocs\peqphpeditor-master\` folder.

Copy the file `config.php.dist` and rename it `config.php`.

#### Configure PEQ Database Editor

Open the `config.php` file with a text editor and fill in your information (default values used below).

{% hint style="success" %}
If you don't know your login information, remember that you can reference it in your `eqemu_config.json` file found in your server folder.
{% endhint %}

```
/**
 * Database info
 */
$dbhost = env('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
$dbuser = env('DB_USER', 'root');
$dbpass = env('DB_PASSWORD', 'eqemu');
$db     = env('DB_NAME', 'peq');
$dbport = env('DB_PORT', 3306);
```

Save your changes to the configuration file.

#### Update Database Schema

Navigate to the `sql` folder (ex. `C:\xampp\htdocs\peqphpeditor-master\sql\`

Open the file `schema.sql` with a text editor and copy and paste the contents into the HeidiSQL Client's query window and execute (HeidiSQL installed when you used Akkadius' EQEmu Windows Installer Script).

Open the file `expansions.sql` with a text editor and copy and paste the contents into the HeidiSQL Client's query window and execute.

#### Configure PHP

Navigate to the PHP folder (i.e. C:\xampp\php)

Open the `php.ini` file with a text editor.

Locate the `short_open_tag` line and set it to `On`.

![Search for "short\_open\_tag" and set to On](../../.gitbook/assets/php-ini-short\_open\_tag.png)

Also look for **error\_reporting** to turn turn off some warnings.

```
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Restart (stop/start) your Apache service or process after any changes to .conf or .ini files
{% endhint %}

### Navigate to your PEQ Database Editor

Open a browser and navigate to your new local copy of the PEQ Database Editor (default directory example below):

```
http://localhost/peqphpeditor-master/index.php
```

Enter the default username and password: "admin" and "password".

{% hint style="info" %}
When shutting down XAMPP and/or the computer, it is recommended to stop MySQL/MariaDB through the console rather than using the control panel. The reason is that the control panel just kills the process rather than letting the database shut down cleanly. Losing power or shutting down the database server using the control panel has been known to corrupt databases. The HTTP (Apache) server can be stopped from the control panel without issues.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you aren't running MySQL/MariaDB as a service (i.e. you started the database manually), it is a good idea to shut down the database cleanly. To do this, open a command prompt (from the XAMPP control panel if you haven't added MySQL/MariaDB to your PATH variables) and run the following command (only use the -p if your root user has a password):
{% endhint %}

```
mysqladmin shutdown -uroot -p
```
