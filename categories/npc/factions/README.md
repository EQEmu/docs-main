# Factions

The faction system is pretty simply really, but it can also be quite confusing if you don't understand the purpose of some of the tables, or you don't understand how all the tables interact. These pages should help you get a high level understanding of the faction system, the database tables related to faction functionality, and how to use the system to get the results you expect.
