## 12/27/2009

* **Derision** Fix to set required heading when zoning.

## 12/23/2009

* **cavedude** \(Kilelen\) Added quest functions quest::checktitle\(int titleset\), quest::enabletitle\(int titleset\), and quest::removetitle\(int titleset\) to allow Perl to enable or remove titles for a player.

Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/1057\_titles.sql

## 11/21/2009

* **KLS** Ad hoc task selectors should ignore tasks that are not enabled now.

## 11/19/2009

## 11/18/2009

* **KLS** Added check for character deletion as pointed out by Rogean.

## 10/31/2009

* **AndMetal** Changed HP regen calculations to be Live-like. Basically higher level regen will be about 50% more than it is currently & FD regen should be better than standing, but less than sitting \(instead of 25% of sitting regen\).
* **AndMetal** Races that get the HP Regen "bonus" \(Iksar & Troll by default\) can be customized as a bitmask via rule Character:BaseHPRegenBonusRaces\(4352\).
* **AndMetal** Added \#setallskills alias for \#setallskill/\#setskillall.
* **AndMetal** Added '\#rules get \[rule\]' for a single rule & '\#rules values \[catname\]' for a category to allow real-time viewing of the rule values from the zone \(not the DB\).
* **AndMetal** Added client HP, Mana, & Endurance regen info to \#showstats/\#mystats

## 10/30/2009

* **KLS** Exported DoSpecialAttackDamage\(\) to perl::mob;

## 10/25/2009

* **WildcardX** Tweaked guilds a little to accomodate integrating BOTS.
* **WildcardX** Bots can not join guilds in the same way as characters can. Bots can only be members, not officers.
* **WildcardX** Deprecated the legacy BotRaids system and all \#bot raid commands. Also deprecated the legacy botgroups table.
* **WildcardX** Renamed the \#bot group order ... series of commands into only \#bot group ...

 1040\_DeprecatedBotRaidsSystems.sql

## 10/23/2009

* **KLS** Added discussed work around for SoF &gt; level 75 issue from forums.
* **WildcardX** Bot pets and bot pet items and bot pet buffs will now save their state to the database between zones and camps just like a character.

 1038\_botpetstatepersists.sql

## 10/21/2009

* **WildcardX** Bots will now persist their buffs to the database while zoning or camped.

 1036\_botbuffs.sql

## 10/20/2009

* **WildcardX** Bots can now be a group leader.

Please see \#bot botgroup help for details. The legacy BotRaids logic will be removed from the server code in the next 24/48 hours. This effectivly makes bot raiding the same as before the raid system was created. Much of the existing "\#bot group order" commands will also be deprecated soon.
* **WildcardX** Fix for a bug with \#bot botgroup add.
* **WildcardX** Fix for a bug with bot group leader's record in group\_id table not removing any older records.

 1030\_botzoningsupport.sql

## 10/18/2009

 1027\_botactives.sql

## 10/17/2009

* **WildcardX** A character and a bot can now recieve an ldon adventure.

 1022\_botadventuring.sql

## 10/15/2009

* **AndMetal** Fixed some "no newline at end of file" warnings.
* **AndMetal** Corrected formatting/typo for some \# commands.
* **AndMetal** Fixed a memory leak in Client::ZonePC\(\).

* **KLS** Added private\_corpse to npctypes to dictate whether a corpse will unlock to outside people or not, by default\(0\) it will unlock.

## 09/08/2009

* **Trevius** SoF \* Corrected disciplines for SoF clients so they can load up to 100 instead of being cut-off at 50 max.

* **KLS** Added \#path move and \#path disconnect all.

## 7/24/2009

* **KLS** Small tweaks to npc spell ai.
* **KLS** SoF \* Raids should now function properly.

* **Trevius** SoF \* Adjusted how AAs are loaded to allow all to be fully functional.  This is a temp work-around until the correct way is finalized.
* **KLS** Lowered aggro backstabs generates by roughly 2/3 for a high level rogue, probably a bit less for a low level rogue.
* **KLS** Backstab will now use the backstab damage field from items instead of weapon damage.
* **KLS** Redid all combat skill ups, can only skill up against light blue targets or better for offensive and defensive actions, wont work against clients or NPCs who don't have aggro lists.
* **KLS** Mobs will prefer targets who are not feared to targets who are feared when selecting new targets.
* **KLS** Added Rule \(Character, MaxFearDurationForPlayerCharacter\).
* **KLS** Fear will now cause PCs to run instead of just be stunned, beware.

* **KLS** Reworked EVENT\_COMBAT to be both more efficient and smoother, no longer having an arbitrary delay before it fires.
* **KLS** Took out code in HateList::IsEmpty\(\) that no longer makes any sense to me, it should be noticably faster.

* **AndMetal** AAs are now calculated in CalcBonuses for clients.

  ```text
      AAs that have been converted: (Advanced) Innate STR / STA / AGI / DEX / INT / WIS / CHA, Innate Enlightenment, Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement, Planar Durability, Packrat. They should already be in the PEQ aa_effects table.
      For new AAs, you'll want to modify the StatBonuses struct in zone/mob.h. You'll also need to add a case in ApplyAABonuses in zone/bonuses.cpp to add it to aabonuses.
  ```

* **AndMetal** \(via Congdar\) Fix for quest::traindiscs\(\).
* **AndMetal** Fixed Packrat. However, it doesn't seem to be updating correctly to the client \(or we're taking too much off\).
* **AndMetal** Added weight to \#showstats, accurate to 1 decimal point.
* **KLS** NPCs will no longer try to base their attack speed off weapons they're using, the code wasn't working anyway.

Required SQL: \utils\sql\svn\665\_heroic\_resists.sql Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/667\_titles.sql

Recommended SQL: \(This is recommended for databases that don't stay current with PEQ or are custom\) UPDATE items SET backstabdmg = damage WHERE backstabdmg = 0 AND itemtype = 2;

* **Warning** If you do not have a spells\_new table yet, you must create one and load spells into it or zones will crash when loading in. To create the spells\_new table, use the SQL from \utils\sql\svn\230\_spells\_table.sql After creating the table, you can import or export your spells from the spells\_us.txt file by using the scripts: import\_spells.pl export\_spells.pl

  The easiest way to import your spell file to the table is to move the import\_spells.pl file to your main server directory where your spells\_us.txt file and your eqemu\_config.xml file are. Then run the following command at a command prompt: perl import\_spells.pl

See this post for more information on importing/exporting the spell file: [http://www.eqemulator.net/forums/showpost.php?p=160509&postcount=45](http://www.eqemulator.net/forums/showpost.php?p=160509&postcount=45)

## 06/07/2009

NOTE \(WildcardX\): This version of the server code is a little dangerous for BOT enabled servers. I do not recommend using this revision for BOT enabled servers. Most of the existing BOT code is going to be re-implemented as a "BOT" object in the server code so until I complete this architecture change the BOT code may become somewhat unstable. I apologize for the inconvience but this is necessary to allow the server code for the BOTs to be more flexible and extensible than it is now.

* **Derision** Fixed a memory leak in fishing/foraging code.
