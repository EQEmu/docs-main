Optional SQL: utils/sql/svn/1144\_optional\_rule\_return\_nodrop

* **Derision** Implemented Secondary Forte AA.

## 01/21/2010

* **Trevius/Andmetal** Added new Spell Globals system.  Adding spells to the new spell\_globals table with a qglobal name and value there will require characters to have the matching qglobal in the quest\_globals table in order to scribe spells via the quest::scribespells command. Note: Only integers can be used for values currently.
* **Trevius** Added EnableSpellGlobals rule to enable/disable the new Spell Globals system.

Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/1136\_spell\_globals.sql

* **joligario** New EVENT\_WAYPOINT\_ARRIVE and EVENT\_WAYPOINT\_DEPART. The old EVENT\_WAYPOINT will be removed shortly, so be sure to replace all occurences of EVENT\_WAYPOINT with EVENT\_WAYPOINT\_DEPART in all your current scripts.
* **joligario** Faction values of zero are no longer written to the faction\_values table.
* **WildcardX** Smoothed out bot melee animations. Another attempt at isolating the \#bot camp zone crash bug.

## 01/17/2010

* **WildcardX** More bot ai refactoring that is focused on making the bot movements more smooth and accurate. Still a lingering issue when bots fight a mob that has a giant body type.
* **WildcardX** Bots in melee range of their target will now seperate themselves some so they won't appear so much on top of each other in combat. "Tank" classes will always be closer than "DPS" classes.
* **WildcardX** Fixed a issue with bot pet hitpoints not persisting correctly to the database and an issue that prevented the client from getting all HP updates for bots and their pets.

## 01/15/2010

* **Derision** Added check in Handle\_ApplyPoison to verify the specified inventory slot contains a poison in case the player moved items around after beginning to apply the poison.
* **Derision** Fixed a bug where Mend would not report failures for skill levels below 75.

## 01/15/2010

* **WildcardX** Refactored the general bot ai logic. It appears I have bots properly showing their run animations and bots will now stand before they cast a spell. Because I touched soo much bot ai code, this rev should be evaluated fully before implementing on a public play server. I may decide to revert this rev of the bot code if it proves too unstable.

## 01/14/2010

* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug in the EQEmuLoginServer that resulted in the server not processing login requests because the application's connection to its MySQL database engine was closed. I have implemented an auto reconnect feature of the MySQL client api.
* **WildcardX** Cleaned up a couple compiler warnings for EQEmuLoginServer.
* **WildcardX** Refactored some code that worked fine on a Windows OS, but was incompatible with a Linux OS. New code is compatible with both operating systems.

## 01/13/2010

* **WildcardX** Implemented auto melee or archery weapon selection for the bot ranger if the bot ranger is level 61 or better and the bot owner toggled the \#bot archery command. After toggeling once, the bot then decides on archery or melee until the \#bot archery command is toggled again or the bot zones or camps.
* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug that prevented bots from being created on systems running MySQL on a linux OS. Windows MySQL servers were unaffected.
* **WildcardX** Enchanter bots will no longer cast any illusions as part of "buffing". In the near future, I will implement a new \#bot command to cast illusions instead.
* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug that prevent enchanter bots from casting any damage over time or nuke spells against their target.
* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug that caused bots to "ghost" as they followed their client owner.

## 01/12/2010

* **WildcardX** Implemented a bot spellcasting ai overhaul that improves upon the existing ai and creates a framework to expand additional ai enchancements around for bot coders. NOTE: Please evaluate this version of bots BEFORE you replace your existing server as this is still a work in progress.
* **WildcardX** Implemented bot wizard nuke spell selection for the new bot spellcasting ai.
* **WildcardX** Fixed various bugs to now allow any characters except the bot owner to give bot commands or spawn the bot. Also fixed \#bot mana command to filter out non-caster bots.

## 01/10/2010

* **Derision** /invite can now be used to invite a player in another zone into a regular group.

## 01/09/2010

* **Derision** Changed Client::GroupInvite2 to use the Invitee name passed in the OP\_GroupInvite packet rather than the player's target.

## 01/08/2010

* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug that allowed a bot to be created with the same name as an existing player character. This would cause said bot to not zone with other bots the group.
* **WildcardX** Added new bot command, \#bot mana. This will give a mana report for all spawned bots in the zone. Bot mana report spamming is now disabled.

## 01/07/2010

* **WildcardX** Fixed a EQEmuLoginServer crash that can happen as the result of a null reference in the database code.
* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug with bot archery. The command shouldn't crash the zone and the bot should correctly display the bow only.

## 01/06/2010

* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug that prevented Bot casters from casting if a mob becomes enraged.
* **WildcardX** Changed \#bot list and \#bot spawn commands to use bot name instead of the bot table id

 1077\_botgroups.sql
