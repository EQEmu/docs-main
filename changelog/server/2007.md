* **WildcardX** Fixed a bug that prevented a player from experiencing resurrection effects in designated no combat zones.

This avoids certain situations where timers are disabled and then run down without ever being reenabled and essentially being locked down forever unless the database admin resets it manually.
* **KLS** Also fixed a small ptimer expire bug where if the timer just reached zero it would return expired until it was one second past zero.

* **KLS** CalcAC\(\) and CalcATK\(\) now use signed values instead of unsigned.
* **KLS** When a mob returns to their guard point they should now correctly assume their guard heading.
* **KLS** Succor should fully wipe you from hate lists now, as should zoning.
* **KLS** Spin effects are now correctly capped at a max of level 55, all targets above this cannot be affected.
* **KLS** SE\_LimitEffect should now correctly deal with any effect type the spell has and not just the ones hard coded into the server.
* **KLS** \(Cripp\)Fix for zone heading
