## 12/21/2012

* **Sorvani** Items with zero charges remaining and located in a bag will no longer get set to MaxCharges when looted from a corpse. Round 2.

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/queryserv/2304\_qs\_playertradelog.sql

## 12/20/2012

* **Akkadius** Changed maxlevel default value and value for lootdrop\_entries, this is a thing more affecting servers with higher than 127 so this doesn't affect many people.

OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2300\_optional\_loot\_changes.sql

## 12/19/2012

* **Trevius** RoF \* More work on RoF Structs and added the Client Version stuff.
* **Trevius** RoF \* Removed/Disabled most opcodes until we are further along and then I will add them all back in and populate the rest.
* **Trevius** RoF \* Added a new packet dealing with membership status, but it may need more work.
* **Uleat** Added inspect message functionality for SoF+ clients.
* **Uleat** Added bot command \#bot setinspectmessage \(use \#bot setinspectmessage help\)

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2299\_required\_inspectmessage\_fields.sql

## 12/18/2012

* **Lerxst** Added the RoF.cpp files to the patches folder of the project for the vs2008 people.

## 12/17/2012

* **Sorvani** Added the RoF.cpp files to the patches folder of the project for the windows people.
* **Akkadius** Added EntityList::GetDoorsByDoorID\(int32 id\) which is exported to Perl $entity\_list-&gt;GetDoorsByDoorID
* **Akkadius** Added Door Class object $Door-&gt;GetDoorID\(\); to return the obvious Door ID for the entity

## 12/15/2012

* **Trevius** Initial addition of the RoF client.  Currently disabled by default.  Uncomment the 2 RoF lines in common/patches/patches.cpp to enable the client.

## 12/13/2012

* **Sorvani** \(Uleat\) Player Inspect works for Titanium users again. Spell casting from a clicky effect checks that the item is still in the slot it was cast from before applying the affect and removing the charge \(if applicable\).

## 12/08/2012

Secrets/ _\*Akkadius_ Implemented the customary ability to scale an NPC's spell damage or healing % by a modifier loaded from the npc data in npc\_types This will allow an NPC to do for example 150% of the damage of their damage spells if spellscale is set to '150' 'healscale' field needs to be set to affect heals in a similar manner Both of these can also be accessed via ModifyNPCStat through 'healscale' and 'spellscale'

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2283\_required\_npc\_changes.sql

## 12/06/2012

* **Secrets** Fixed OP\_PVPStats in HoT to the proper opcode, OP\_WebLink. You can use $client-&gt;SendWebLink\("website"\); in perl to use this functionality to pop open a web browser ingame.

## 12/05/2012

* **Akkadius** Ability to send signals through the Telnet console to character: signalcharbyname  

## 12/04/2012

* **Sorvani** \(Uleat\) Update to inspect \(SoF+\) and corpses to related to handling power sources. Titanium inspect still broken.
* **Vaion** Renamed the rule for targeting swarm pets so that it make sense with the code.

OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2280\_optional\_rule\_targetableswarmpet-rename.sql

## 12/3/2012

* **Vaion** New rule created for handling whether swarm pets are targetable or not.  Set to false for default to allow targeting swarm pets.

OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2278\_optional\_rule\_targetableswarmpet.sql

## 12/2/2012

* **Secrets** Pets can no longer proc from any hand other than their primary hand. This fixes an issue where beastlord pets could proc two, three or four from dual wielding/double attacking pets \(as well as a general mechanics fix\).
* **Secrets** NPCs will no longer attempt to heal through walls. There is now a LOS check for friendly NPC heals through walls. This was especially apparent in the PEQ database in Splitpaw, where you could have maybe 10 NPCs healing through walls at a time. I don't recall this ever happening on live past OoW. If this is incorrect revert it and make it a rule.

## 12/1/2012

* **Vaion** Swarm Pets are now untargetable.  They still gain aggro, are attackable and can be casted on by NPCs, but clients cannot target them.
* **Sorvani** Items with 0 charges will no longer get a free recharge when players die. Changed the TargetName property for all projects to be $\(ProjectName\). The only project that will have a new name is chatserver. It is now called ucs matching the linux build.

## 11/27/2012

* **Sorvani** fix for newly created items with unlmiited charges to actually be usable.
* **Sorvani** \(Uleat\) Lore check is now made for items inside bags being trade before the trade completes.
* **Akkadius** Started first works of implementing QueryServ for what it was meant to be used
* **Akkadius** Moved QueryServ to it's own configuration block in the eqemu\_config.xml \(example\):

  localhost3306rootpasswordqueryserv

* **Akkadius** QueryServ can now be used on a separate server and can use an entirely separate database as it was meant to
* **Akkadius** Added 'loottable\_id\` to NPC::ModifyNPCStat which also changes quest::ModifyNPCStat\(identifier, newValue\); as well
* **Akkadius** Fixed heap corruption in quest\_globals that would occur if a value over 64 bytes was created
* **Akkadius** Changed value size in qglobals from 64 bytes to 128 bytes
* **Akkadius** Added \#reloadworld \* This command will reload every single zones Perl quests and repop them
* **Secrets** Minor code fix for qglobals. Since we removed the id field from qglobals, I suppose we shouldn't use it in code.
* **Secrets** Warning fix for a quest function.
* **Secrets** Fixed a crash issue where player corpses did not exist at all in a function \(ie; they were disabled\) yet we are trying to use an invalid pointer
* **Secrets** durp, i'm retarded. memleak fix.

Perl Changes:

* **Akkadius** Added EVENT\_DISCONNECT to global\_player.pl/player.pl \* Event that triggers whenever a character disconnects from the world
* **Akkadius** Added EVENT\_CONNECT to global\_player.pl/player.pl \* Event that triggers whenever a character connects to the world
* **Akkadius** Added EVENT\_TASK\_UPDATE to global\_player.pl/player.pl \* Event that triggers whenever a donecount is incremented in a task, exports variables: $donecount, $activity\_id and $task\_id
* **Akkadius** Added EVENT\_TASK\_COMPLETE to global\_player.pl/player.pl \* Event that triggers whenever a task is complete, this can sort of be checked in EVENT\_TASK\_STAGE\_COMPLETED already but this is more finite, exports variables: $donecount, $activity\_id and $task\_id
* **Akkadius** Added EVENT\_TASK\_FAIL to global\_player.pl/player.pl \* Event that triggers whenever a task has failed, exports variables: $task\_id
* **Akkadius** Added $client-&gt;SignalClient\($data\), it uses the client as the initiator and the client that gets sent the data, good for entity\_list iterations through client
* **Akkadius** Exported $client-&gt;AddAlternateCurrencyValue\(currency\_id, amount\); originally created by KLS
* **Akkadius** Added quest::gettaskactivitydonecount\(task, activity\); which obviously will get the amount done in a task based on task and activity
* **Akkadius** Added cross zone client signalling capability by character ID: quest::crosszonesignalclientbycharid\(char\_id, data\);
* **Akkadius** Added cross zone client signalling capability by character Name: quest::crosszonesignalclientbyname\(Name, data\);
* **Akkadius** Added cross zone client messaging capability by character Name: quest::crosszonemessageplayerbyname\(Type, Name, Message\);
* **Akkadius** Added the ability to flow \#commands through Perl, by flow meaning if the command doesn't process through the traditional command system, it will dump the output to EVENT\_SAY in player.pl/global\_player.pl based on rule Chat:FlowCommandstoPerl\_EVENT\_SAY

QueryServ Changes:

* I plan on adding much more logging to this server, but for now I've started with the following:
* QueryServ requires rules to be enabled before packets get sent to QueryServ, otherwise World/Zone doesn't need to even craft the packets for logging
* **Akkadius** Logging all player kills through QueryServ, you need to have QueryServ:PlayerLogNPCKills Rule Enabled, type: 0 = Solo, 1 = Group, 2 = Raid
* **Akkadius** Player trades logging started but definitely not finished
* **Akkadius** Removed the rules system from QueryServ, rules should only be read from World/Zone

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/queryserv/2268\_QueryServ.sql

Database Changes:

* **Akkadius** Added a field in `character_` called `firstlogon` that will essentially be booled true when a player logs on, it handles a characters online status between world and zone and ultimately gets used in EVENT\_CONNECT
* **Akkadius** Completely dropped the `id` column in `quest_globals`, the \(`charid`, `npcid`, `zoneid`, `name`\) fields will act as the primary keys, tested and working fine. This solves capping out on ID's as they are unecessary.
* **Akkadius** Changed value size of `quest_globals` field `value` from 64 bytes to 128 bytes
* **Akkadius** Removed an AA that was causing heap corruption

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2268\_required\_updates.sql

## 11/25/2012

* **JJ** Initial fix for /MQZone detection to reduce false positives.
* **Sorvani** Corrected Improved Familiar pre-req and commited Vaion's AA update to fix animation Empathy.

  Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/2264\_required\_aa\_updates.sql

## 11/24/2012

* **Sorvani** \(Vaion\) Added /pet no cast and /pet focus

  Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/2262\_required\_pet\_discipline\_update.sql

## 11/23/2012

* **cavedude** \(Tabasco\) Re-added probability, setting it to 100 \(default\) effectively bypasses probability and no additional roll is made. Setting it to 0 prevents the table from being rolled at all, so you can disable the table but still keep the entries if needed.

  Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/2260\_probability.sql

## 11/22/2012

* **Sorvani** Tabasco sent in this bugfix: Ranged attack crash

  It doesn't happen every time, but if an NPC is flagged for ranged attacks and they kill their target, the AIProcess function continues on under the assumption that the target is still available.

I just adjusted it to set a flag and do the actual attack at the end of the function. I haven't been able to reproduce the crash since.

## 10/31/2012

* **Akkadius** Added the ability to govern player max levels through the source per character. It will look for a qglobal named 'CharMaxLevel', type 5 qglobal, if the rule is enabled and the character flag is set, they will not be able to pass that level.

  Optional SQL: utils/sql/svn/2243\_optional\_char\_max\_level\_rule.sql

## 10/22/2012

* **Lerxst2112** Fixed issue in AddMoneyToPP where the amount of silver was being added to copper instead of the leftover copper.

## 10/03/2012

* **Sorvani** Disabled optimization around the DECODE\(OP\_CharacterCreate\) in all SoF+ patches to force character creation to validate correctly.

## 10/02/2012

* **Sorvani** A NPC that is immune to Mez, Slow, Fear, Charm, or Snare will now generate aggro based on the respective spell's normal aggro.

## 09/28/2012

* **Sorvani** SE\_SummonCorpse will now work in raid groups.

## 09/27/2012

* **Bad\_Captain** Bots\* Changed \#bot healrotation timer to allow decimal values.
* **Bad\_Captain** Bots\* Rewrote bot AAs to load from DB.
* **Bad\_Captain** Bots\* Synced bot code to client code for aabonuses, attack, spell casting, etc., as the result of the client aabonuses changes.

## 09/23/2012

* **Kayen** Fix for crippling blow chance, other minor fixes related to bonuses.

## 09/20/2012

* **Kayen** AA dbase table fixes \* Archery Mastery, Fury of Magic.

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2215\_required\_aa\_updates

## 09/19/2012

* **KLS** Faction mods \(Race, Class, Deity\) can now be added on the fly, without adding database columns or editing the code. Source in the database change, run utils/factionmod.pl, and then drop the faction\_list table to convert.

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2214\_faction\_list\_mod.sql

## 09/18/2012

* **cavedude** Overhauled loot system. I've outlined the new system on the forums here: [http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?t=35770](http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?t=35770)

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2213\_loot\_changes.sql

## 09/16/2012

* **Kayen** Implemented SE\_HealFromMana changed to SE\_HealGroupFromMana \* now implemented correctly.

## 09/14/2012

* **Kayen** Implemented SE\_CriticalHealRate \* Focus that increase chance for heals cast on you to critical.
* **Kayen** Implemented SE\_IncreaseNumHits \* Focus that can inceases max number of hits a buff can have before being removed.
* **Kayen** Removed SE\_Twinproc \* This is not an actual spell effect, Twin proc is now correctly implemented as on live using SE\_Twincast.
* **Kayen** Implemented SE\_TwoHandBluntBlock \* Chance to block when using two hand blunt weapon \(similiar to shield block\).
* **Kayen** SE\_NegateEffect will now negate all AA, item and spell bonuses for the specified effects.
* **Kayen** Added support to allow for certain bonuses to now properly be calculated when cast as debuffs \(ie decrease chance to critical hit\)
* **Kayen** Implemented rule to allow certain bonuses to be calculated by adding together the value from each item, instead of taking the highest value.

  \*Ie. Add together all worn cleave effects, ferocity effects ect.

OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2209\_optional\_additive\_bonus\_rule.sql \(disabled by default\)

## 09/13/2012

* **cavedude** Uleat implemented the following changes:

The bandolier function should no longer CAUSE desyncs. Its use can still be affected by previous issues, just like any manual swap. Message cues have been temporarily added to certain procedures to indicate to the player that a possible desync condition exists and that they should zone or relog to correct the situation immediately.

The chance of player corpses becoming bugged should now be minimal. Corpse processing was changed to better emulate client behavior when 'RespawnFromHover' is set to true or false. Message cues and \#commands were added to help determine whether a corpse is bugged. \(Previously, queued cursor items were sent to the corpse..but, the packet builder did not include the 8000-series of items when a player looted their corpse.\)

Tweaked several areas where item swaps were not handled properly, or at all, and the client-server inventories became desyncronized. Additional areas are still suspect for causing desync's. \(A 'ResyncInventory' method is in-work to eliminate the need for item deletion...\)

Client::SummonItem now limits the size of a summoned stack to the value of stacksize in the database. If you are using script to summon stacks greater than item-&gt;stacksize, this action was/is incorrect and you will need to modify your 'quest' to summon multiple stacks.

command changes:

```text
#equipitem * modified partial stack movements..if a partial stack would be left on cursor, the action now fails.
#corpse * added subcommand 'InspectLoot'..works for client and npc corpses..additional information with client.
#peekinv * added stack size(charges) to report and modified the cursor depth reporting of bag slots.
#zopp * new command for troubleshooting..forces a client 'trade' or 'summon' to desync the client inventory.
```

* **Kayen** Almost all 'General' and most 'Archetype' AA's implemented through Underfoot.
* **Kayen** aaID data \(AA.h\) updated through VoA expansion.

Following AA effects are now implemented as bonuses: You must update your 'aa\_effects' table with 'required\_aa\_updates.sql' for these to work. MISC AA: Spell Casting Subtlety now implemented with bonus SE\_ChangeAggro MISC AA: Many AA that are spell focus effects now implemented using live data. MISC AA: Finishing Blow ect, will now implemented using bonus, SE\_FinishingBlow and SE\_FinishingBlowLvl. ENC AA: Total Domination now implemented with bonus SE\_CharmBreakChance.

* **Akkadius** First set of efforts to clean up Windows compiling. See:

    [http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?p=212217\#post212217](http://www.eqemulator.org/forums/showthread.php?p=212217#post212217)

  * Cleaned up x64 compiles, x86 compiles coming right up
  * Removed pragma comments and forced them to be used under 'Additional Dependencies' \(Windows\)

* **Akkadius** Fixed-up Release & Debug 32-bit compiles
* **Akkadius** Uploading includes and libraries for both x64 and x86 so that VS2010 can automatically reference those libraries and requires no configuration
* **Akkadius** All project types have had includes and libraries linked to the appropriate machine type
* **Akkadius** Most project types have been set to /MP \(Multiprocessor compile\) and Warning Level 1 to filter most of the garbage
* **Akkadius** Got the rest of the VS2010 compiles working on a fresh SVN:

  ```text
    Debug x64|x64 = Debug x64|x64
    Debug|Win32 = Debug|Win32
    Debug|x64 = Debug|x64
    DebugBots x64|x64 = DebugBots x64|x64

* **cavedude** Added quest::clearhandin and \#clearquestitems so that multiquest can co-exist with out current system without issues.

REQUIRED plugin: utils/defaults/plugins/check\_handin.pl \(Or use PEQ quests repo\)

## 08/27/2012

* **Akkadius** \(Uleat\) Temporary dupe fix until we can iron this out the way it should be \(Not use signed ints in the blob\). This should trap a majority of it to client saves.
* **Akkadius** Account shared platinum field type change \(signed to unsigned\) to no longer allow negative values...

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2195\_required\_sharedplatupdates.sql

## 08/17/2012

* **Kayen** Taunt skill updated to work consistent with live.

  \*You can now taunt NPC's over the users level. \(RULE: TauntOverLevel\)

  \*Taunt success chance should be accurate to live. Penalty of not being at max skill lv can be adjusted with \(RULE: Combat:TauntSkillFalloff\)

  \*Live messages for taunt success and failure are now implemented. \(Note: Only NPC races that can 'talk' will say the success message\).

* **Bad\_Captain** Bots\* Fixed an issue when with bot spell timers that could lead to a crash.
* **Kayen** Fixed SQL files from rev2185+ that were not saved as .sql

OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2189\_optional\_taunt\_rules OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2185\_optional\_NPCFlurryChance\_rule \(run this again\)

## 08/16/2012

* **Kayen** Complete revision of the Death Save and Divine Save effects and related bonuses to be consistent with live. _Death Save \(Death Pact/DI\) will no longer fire on death. It should only fire when less 15% HP but not killed._ Death Save chance is determined soley by charisma of client with the buff. \(RULE: DeathSaveCharismaMod\) _Divine Intervention baseline is now correctly set to 8000HP \(from 50k\) \(RULE: DivineInterventionHeal\)_ AA Touch of the Divine provides upon failure of first Death Save, a second roll and if successful will do a portion of the original heal value. \(Ie DI=8000HP with ToTD-3\(60%\) your heal will be 8000_0.6 = 4800HP\)_ Implemented functionality for later expansion Death Save effects \(Divine Intercession ect\) These can add heal value to the base heal which is limited by level \(ie Heal 10,0000+8000 if client less then level 80\)

  _Divine Save \(AA Unfailing Divinity\) only fire upon death of client with this effect and is independent of Death Save effect._ Increased ranks of AA only increase the chance of firing upon death. Heal value does NOT increase with rank. \*Upon firing you will still recieve the Divine Aura like buff, which now also correctly removes all determental effects.

* **Kayen** Implemented: SE\_Purify \* Removes determental buffs. Value determines how many buffs are removed.
* **Kayen** Added RULE MaxCastTimeReduction \* Max percent your spell cast time can be reduced by spell haste\(is/was 50%\).

Following AA effects are now implemented as bonuses: You must update your 'aa\_effects' table with 'required\_aa\_updates.sql' for these to work. MISC AA: Internal Metronome/Channeling Focus now implemented with bonus, SE\_ChannelChanceSpells. MISC AA: Concentration now correctly implemented with bonus, SE\_ChannelChanceItems. MISC AA: Pet Affinity now implemented with bonus, SE\_GivePetGroupTarget. MISC AA: Spell Casting Expertise, Mastery of the Past ect will prevent fizzles from spells under certain level, SE\_MasteryofPast. BRD AA: Extended Notes/Sionachie's Crescendo will increase ranage of songs with bonus, SE\_SongRange. BRD AA: Jam Fest now implemented with bonus, SE\_CastingLevel2. CLR AA: Unfailing Divinity now implemented with bonus SE\_Unfailing Divinity. CLR AA: Touch of the Divine now implemented with bonus SE\_DivineSave. DRU AA: Enchanted root/Viscid Root \(was implemented completely wrong\), now uses bonus SE\_RootBreakChance. _If a root is cast on the target and target has this AA it will decrease the chance for that root to break from any damage spells. The damage spells can be cast by any one, not just the client with the bonus. Added RULE: RootBreakFromSpells_  Baseline is/was set at 20% chance from nukes.

REQUIRED SQL: utils/sql/svn/2188\_required\_aa\_updates OPTIONAL SQL: utils/sql/svn/2188\_optional\_miscspelleffect\_rules

## 08/13/2012

* **Kayen** Update to how chance to hit bonuses are applied.

  \*Accuracy spell effect will now stack with Hit Chance spell effect. \(Accuracy/15 = 1% chance to hit\).

  \*Skill specific Hit Chance effects should stack correctly now.

  \*Accuracy/Hit Chance effects that DECREASE your chance to hit will now function.

* **Kayen** Minor update to duel wield, chance bonuses will be correctly applied to baseline dw chance.
* **Kayen** Implemented Perl MOB Quest Object SetFlurryChance\(value\) \(ie 50 = 50% chance for NPC flurry if special atk "F"\)
* **Kayen** Implemented Perl MOB Quest Object GetFlurryChance\(value\) returns flurry chance.
* **Kayen** Added rule to adjust server wide flurry chance \(Default = 20%\) \*Perl object will override this.

Following AA effects are now implemented as bonuses: You must update your 'aa\_effects' table with 'required\_aa\_updates.sql' for these to work. MISC AA: Dead Aim, Precision of the Hunter, Scout's Efficiency will now calculate from bonus SE\_Accuracy.

## 08/08/2012

* **Kayen** Updates to critical hit calcuations to be consistent with live.

  \*Baseline critical rate is determined by DEX stat \(255 dex = 2%\),this baseline is then modified by item,spell and AA critical chance bonuses.

  \*Pet critical baseline is determined by the rate from AA effects that give pets the ability to critical. \(Can not crit w/o this effect\)

* **Kayen** Slay Undead effect will now be working consistent with live.

  \*Slay rate is no longer effected by critical hit rate, it uses it's own predetermined rates from the spell effect data.

  \*Damage modification will now be much closer to that of lives utilizing the spell effects damage modifier.

  _Example\(AA Slay Undead I_  Rate: 225 \(2.25%\) Damage Mod: 680%\)

  \*Note that that spell effects using Slay Undead \(Holyforge\) will stack with AA and increase the damage and the rate.

* **Kayen** Crippling Blow's derived from spell effects will now be calculated consistent with live.

  \*Cippling blow chance is determined by modifying your critical hit chance.

  _Example \(Savage Onslaught_  200% chance to crippling blow\) If you have a base chance to critical hit of 10%

   and you score a critical hit, you will then have a 20% chance to crippling blow.

* **Kayen** Fixed effect for AA 'War Cry' will now provide group fear immunity for duration.
* **Kayen** Few new AA's added including shaman Ancestral Aid and Spirit Channeling.

Following AA effects are now implemented as bonuses: You must update your 'aa\_effects' table with 'required\_aa\_updates.sql' for these to work. MISC AA: 'Combat Fury', 'Fury of the Ages' will now calculate from bonus SE\_CriticalHitChance. MISC AA: 'Veteran's Wrath' will now calculate from bonus SE\_CriticalDmgMod. MISC AA: All AA that give pet criticals will be calculated from SE\_PetCriticalHit. PAL AA: 'Slay Undead', 'Vanquish Undead' will now calculate from bonus SE\_SlayUndead. \(Holyforge now works correctly\)

## 08/05/2012

* **Kayen** Complete revision of how double attack chance is calculate to be consistent with live.
* **Kayen** Berserker 'Frenzy' skill attack will now function as it does on live. Gives a chance for 1-3 attacks using frenzy skill specific damage.

  \*Note: This will be a considerable nerf to bersekers because it was previously coded to give actual melee rounds using weapon damage.

* **Kayen** Implemented a few miscellaneous new AA's, mostly from DODH. \(These will show in OoW Window in Titanium\)
* **Kayen** Added almost all remaining spell effects into spdat.h \(~90% defined\).
* **Kayen** Alternate Advancement Update: In the process of coverting most of the hard coded AA data out of the source and into the 'aa\_effects' table

  using live data. These effects are then reimplemented using the bonus system in the broadest possible way, most of these effects will

  also be useable as regular spell/item effects. This will allow developers in the future to adjust,implement and customize AA effects

  without requiring source changes. Beware in doing this, many AA effects that were previously either implemented incorrectly or with values

  not consistent with live data will be adjusted to be as accurate as possible.

Following AA effects are now implemented as bonuses: You must update your 'aa\_effects' table with 'required\_aa\_updates.sql' for these to work. MISC AA: All innate run speed AA's have been converted to use bonus SE\_BaseMovementSpeed. MISC AA: All bind wound related AA have been converted to use bonuses, SE\_ImprovedBindWound, SE\_MaxBindWound. MISC AA: Shield Block will now be calculated using bonuses, SE\_ShieldBlock. MISC AA: Sinister Strike will now correctly allow your off hand weapon to recieve a weapon damage bonus, SE\_SecondaryDmgInc. MISC AA: Strengthened Strike/Vicious Smash/Kick Mastery will now accurately to live add skill damage to respective special abilities. MISC AA: StrikeThrough, Tactical Mastery  _will now be calculated from bonus, SE\_Strikethrough2. MISC AA: Ferocity, Knight's Advantage ect_  will now be calculated from bonus SE\_DoubleAttackChance. MISC AA: Harmonious Attacks, Bestial Frenzy  _will allow double attack chance using bonus SE\_GiveDoubleAttack \(any class can be given this\) MISC AA: Weapon Affinity, will now use SE\_ProcChance. MISC AA: PunishingBlade, SpeedoftheKnight will now allow an extra 2 Handed attack using bonus, SE\_ExtraAttackChance. BRD AA: Fleet of Foot will now correctly allow bards to run over the speed cap using, SE\_IncreaseRunSpeedCap. WAR AA: Previously non functional 'Stalwart Endurance' and 'Dauntless Preservence' now working using bonus, SE\_FrontalStunResist MNK AA: HightenedAwareness_  Implemented using bonus, SE\_BlockBehind. MNK AA: Technique of Master Wu  _Will now correclty use a random monk special attack, chance for double/triple attack as SE\_DoubleSpecialAttack. MNK AA: Dragon Punch_  Implemented as now using bonus SE\_SpecialAttackKBProc, \(base1 = 100 \[25% proc chance at 100\] base2 = skill\) RNG AA: Endless Quiver  _Implemented as SE\_ConsumeProjectile which gives a percent chance NOT to consume an arrow. \(EQ base1 = 100\) RNG AA: Archery Mastery_ Implemented as SE\_ArcheryDamageModifier which gives a percent increase to archery attacks. BER AA: Throwing Mastery  _Implemented using SE\_DamageModifier. BER AA: Blur of Axes, Vicious Frenzy_  will now correctly add skill damage to 'Frenzy' skill attacks.

## 07/16/2012

* **Kayen** Implemented: SE\_SpellProcChance, SE\_CharmBreakChance, SE\_BalanceMana, SE\_DotCritDmgIncrease, SE\_TripleAttackChance, SE\_Taunt

  ```text
        SE_BardSongRange, SE_ACv2, SE_ManaRegen_v2,    SE_SpellCriticalFocus, SE_AdditionalHeal2, SE_HealRate2,
        SE_CriticalHealOverTime2, SE_CriticalHealChance2, SE_SkillDamageAmount2, SE_LimitSpellSkill, SE_LimitClass
        SE_LimitExcludeSkill, SE_ShieldBlock, SE_BlockBehind
  ```

* **Kayen** Implemented: SE\_Empathy \* A focus limited debuff which causes \(spells/skill attacks\) cast on target to do +X amount more damage.

  ```text
        *This spell effect is often limited using SE_LimitSpellSkill.
        *(Ie. If empathy value is 1000 and limited to evocation, all nukes on target using evoc. will get +1000 damage)
  ```

* **Kayen** Implemented: SE\_SpellPowerIncrease \* Can be used to apply a worn/buff focus effect with limits for...

  ```text
        1) Additional bard instrument modifiers.
        2) Healing/Damage focus to bard songs. (Note: This is only effect that can do this).
        3) Increase effectiviess of casted/disc Skill Attacks.

* **Kayen** Fixed an issue where DOTs cast by an NPC on another NPC would not generate hate per tick. Improved how we calc damage from DOTs.
* **Kayen** SE\_BlockSpellEffect was implemented incorrectly and has been revised to SE\_NegateSpellEffect.

  ```text
    *It is not meant to block buffs, rather it negates the specific spell bonuses or effects from buffs you already have.
    *Currently functional with any effect that is handled under bonuses, and focus effects.
  ```

* **Kayen** Vastly improved how we handle melee/spell runes/partial mitigation runes ect. Should be significantly more efficient.

  ```text
    *Melee/Spell Mitigation runes and ManaAbsorbPercentDamage effects will now use the best mitigation value if multiple effects.
  ```

* **Kayen** Improved the process we use to get spell/item focus effects. An initial check if the client has a specific focusType

  is done while checking for item/spell bonuses. GetFocusEffect will no longer check all inventory and buff slots every cast for the

  focusType if that focusType doesn't exist on the client. This should improve performance since these checks are done 10-20x per cast/proc.

## 07/15/2012

* **Secrets** Fixed an issue with saylinks above 255 characters. If you do want to use saylinks above 255 characters, it is reccomended you adjust the varchar field in the saylinks table to a "TEXT" field, which supports up to 65535 characters.

  ```

* **Kayen** Implemented: SE\_AttackSpeed4: 'Inhibit Melee' effect works different then regular haste/slow effect

  ```text
    1) If target is hasted (or no haste) Inhibit Melee will decrease attack speed by the Inhibit Melee value.
    2) If target is slowed Inhibit Melee is applied as a percent change to remaining attack speed after regular slow.
    ie. You cast 75% Slow (25 attack speed remains) then apply 25% Inhibit melee (18.75 attack speed remains): Final slow 81.75%
  ```

* **Kayen** Added Rule: Spells:CharismaEffectiveness \(Default = 10\) Deterimes how much resist modification charisma applies to charm/pacify checks \(10 CHA = -1 resist mod\).
* **Kayen** Added Rule: Spells:CharmBreakCheckChance \(Default = 25\) Determines percent chance for a charm break check to occur each buff tick.
* **Kayen** Reworked code to that handles charm breaks/lull to be accurate to live and more functional in general.

  ```text
    1) Each charm buff tick there is a default 25% [Rule.CharmBreakCheckChance] chance to trigger a spell resistance check.
    2) Spell resistance check then adds an additional bonus resist modification based casters Charisma at a default
       ratio of 10 CHA per -1 resist mod [Rule.CharismaEffectiveness]
    3) If resisted (ie Charm is to break) Total Domination AA is then applied to give another chance to maintain the charm.

The player credited with the kill \(most hate\) has their level checked against both columns, and if they are lower than the specified minlevel, or higer than the max, that item entry if it exists is removed from the NPC before it becomes a corpse.
* **cavedude** You can now specify if a NPC automatically repops \(rerolls against their spawngroup\) or depops after the reverse spawn timer is up.

  If despawn in spawngroup is set to:

  0 \(Default\): Do not depop or repop, no depop timer is set. \(Same functionality as we had previously.\)

  1: Despawn the current NPC and repop the spawngroup after the associated spawn2 timer is up \(including variance.\)

* Repop, after the value specified in despawn\_timer is up \(also uses spawn2 variance.\)

  3: Depop the NPC after the spawn2 timer is up + variance.

* Depop the NPC after despawn\_timer is up + variance.

  Example: Setting despawn to 1 will despawn the NPC and immediately respawn the spawngroup after it has been up for the length of its spawn2 timer + variance.

  Example: Setting despawn to 4 and despawn\_timer to 3600 will depop the NPC after it has been up for an hour + variance. It then will respawn after its normal respawn timer is up.

* **cavedude** Fixed a crash in groups.cpp.

* **Trevius** Fixed inspect for SoF+ clients, which was broken by Rev2128.

## 04/15/2012

* **Derision** Added support for the 'Looking For Guild' window.

Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/2129\_required\_lfguild.sql

IMPORTANT NOTE:

To use this feature, you must be running the querserv process. If you are not running queryserv, LFGuild will not work, but your server will run normally in all other respects.

Underfoot users can bring up the LFGuild Window by pressing the EQ buton and selecting Players/Looking For Guild.

I think all other clients can only access the feature by clicking on the notice boards in the Guild Lobby. To allow them to do this, you must add the following to the SUB EVENT\_CLICKDOOR of your guildlobby/player.pl

if\(\($doorid &gt;= 5\) && \($doorid &lt;= 38\)\) { $client-&gt;OpenLFGuildWindow\(\); }

* **Trevius** Initial addition of the VoA \(March 21 2012\) client. To enable, you must uncomment the VoA lines in /common/patches.
* **Trevius** Many of the core systems are basically functional, but this client is still in an early development phase and not recommended for normal players yet.
* **Trevius** Non-Player Race spawns will cause the client to crash, so it is recommended to test it in an empty zone.
* **Trevius** Also, items in the bank will cause it to crash, but normal inventory seems to work fine so far.
* **Trevius** You cannot create a character on this client yet, so you must use an existing character.

* **Bad\_Captain** Fixed FindType to allow for spell effects &gt; 127. Observed by bots trying to cure corruption \(effectid 369\) when client has a mount \(summonhorse effectid 113: 369-128-128=113\).
